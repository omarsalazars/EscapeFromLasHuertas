#Escape From Las Huertas
Escape From Las Huertas it's a game similar to Pacman, but it's set in a dangerous neighborhood in Mexico. 
The goal of the game is to collect all the Caguamas Carta Blanca scattered on the map.

We call the enemies "Cholos" and they will try to steal your phone and your wallet. If you run out of cell phone or wallet, they will beat you up.
